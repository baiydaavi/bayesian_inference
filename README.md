The presentation.ipynb is our 'assignment'. If you go through and execute the cells in order you will see the requested results
as well as all of our test functions.

core_mcmc_functions.py contain all the core mcmc chain functions.

prior_likelihood.py contains the prior and likelihood functions.

theoretical_mag.py contains the apparent magnitude calculator function.

test_function.py contains all the test functions.

lambda_cdm_functions.py contains all the functions needed to run the mcmc chain test on the lambda CDM model.
