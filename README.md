A good place to start in this repo is the notebook called "tutorial.ipynb'
it is where you will find the imports and top level commands you would need to run
in order to generate results.

The presentation.ipynb is our 'assignment'. If you go through and execute the cells in order you will see the requested results
as well as all of our test functions
