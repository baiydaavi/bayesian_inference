## Introduction

## Usage

The presentation.ipynb is our 'assignment'. If you go through and execute the cells in order you will see the requested results
as well as all of our test functions.

core_mcmc_functions.py contain all the core mcmc chain functions.

prior_likelihood.py contains the prior and likelihood functions.

theoretical_mag.py contains the apparent magnitude calculator function.

test_function.py contains all the test functions.

lambda_cdm_functions.py contains all the functions needed to run the mcmc chain test on the lambda CDM model.
